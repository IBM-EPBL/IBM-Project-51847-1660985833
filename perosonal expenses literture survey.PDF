This study is aimed at developing an android based mobile application capable of monitoring and controlling personal expenses, as well as cautioning the user against reckless and unbudgeted spending. The developed system was designed using system flowchart, use case diagram, sequence diagram, class diagram and system architecture diagram. It was implemented using Java programming language on android studio and My SQL. The developed system was evaluated based on basic functionality tests performed on the individual modules, the integrated testing as well as the overall function testing. The results of testing the functionalities of the developed system showed that all the modules worked properly when tested individually. They rejected invalid inputs and responded promptly to user requests. Database operations such as insert, update, delete and add that were performed yielded expected results, and data consistency / integrity are maintained in the reports generated. Thus, the developed system provides an easy to use, portable and secured means of enhancing financial sustainability and promotes individual and societal economic growth via fiscal discipline

This application will have a two-tier architecture: first one is the database tier, where all the data and financial data will be stored. Second it will be the user interface which will support the application user communicate with the system and also store Information in the database. The proposed system should operate offline so it can be accessed at any time without internet availability. The proposed system should provide different categories for the user to select from and they can enter the amount and mode of payment. This system should be able to analyze the information, provide analytics on which category did the user spent most of their money. The proposed system should provide a user interface where the user could store and observe their past expenses. To create this system, we will use the android studio and it.It will be written in Java, Xml. MySQL will be the database used.
